# Caden K Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. Not the best out there by any means but it fits my needs perfectly and thats all I care about.
Feel free to look around, fork the repo, or copy any of my settings that you like. ðŸ™‚

## Dotfiles Script
As of now there are a lot of hardcoded values that require the dotfiles to be installed in ~/dotfiles. This includes a very basic python script that runs simple actions of the dotfiles such as installing and updating.
